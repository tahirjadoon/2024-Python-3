Python is a dynamic, interpreted (bytecode-compiled) language. 
There are no type declarations of variables, parameters, functions, or methods in source code. 
Lose the compile-time type checking of the source code. 
Python tracks the types of all values at runtime and flags code that does not make sense as it runs.
